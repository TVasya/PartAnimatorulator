# PartAnimatorulator
PartAnimatorulator is a tool for editing Need for Speed Underground 2's PARTS_ANIMATIONS.BIN files. It's based on AJ_Lethal's PARTS_ANIMATIONS Hex editing guide.

# What you can do with this tool:
1. Easily rename Animation slots (With automatic padding, and find&replace function)
2. Change pivot positions
3. Change car xname (with automatic hashing).

I'd recommend to use LANCEREVO8's animation's file as base for your car mods, since it has longest name and padding.

# Q/A
Q: Can I edit angles of animations with this tool?
A: No, to implement that it needs more research on how part_animations files work.

Q: There was supposed to be Copy and Delete buttons for AnimSlots. Why they were removed?
A: Previously I thought that simply deleting/copying an anim slot will work, but it turned out that it causes game to crash. Again, to implement it properly it needs more research on how part_animations files work.
